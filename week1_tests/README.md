✅ 1. Goal of Week 1

Week 1 is NOT about building the full system.

The goal is:

🔹 Validate that GPT-4.1 can correctly call your backend-style functions.

Meaning:

If the user asks something (“Show me the menu”), the model must call the correct function.

The arguments must be structured properly.

The model must not hallucinate functions.

The JSON must be valid.

This ensures the entire future system works.
